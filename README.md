# BFS Graph Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm in Python using Object-Oriented Programming principles.

## Structure

- `graph.py`: Defines the Graph class.
- `bfs.py`: Defines the BFS class and contains an example of how to use these classes.

## Running the Code

Run the `bfs.py` file to see an example of the BFS algorithm in action:

```bash
python bfs.py
